# API

- APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement.
- They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for home building â€” it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.

- They generally fall into two categories.

  1. **Browser APIs** are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex things.

  - DOM API
  - Geolocation API
  - canvas and WebGL API
  - Audio and Video API

- **The DOM (Document Object Model) API** allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, creating, removing and changing HTML, dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc. Every time you see a popup window appear on a page, or some new content displayed (as we saw above in our simple demo) for example, that's the DOM in action.

- The **Geolocation API** retrieves geographical information. This is how Google Maps is able to find your location and plot it on a map.
- The **Canvas and WebGL APIs** allow you to create animated 2D and 3D graphics.

  2. **Third party APIs** are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to grab their code and information from somewhere on the Web. For example:

  - The **Twitter API** allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website.
  - The **Google Maps API** and OpenStreetMap API allows you to embed custom maps into your website, and other such functionality.
