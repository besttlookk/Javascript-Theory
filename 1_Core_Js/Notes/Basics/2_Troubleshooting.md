# What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

### Types of error

- Generally speaking, when you do something wrong in code, there are **two main types of error** that you'll come across:

  1. **Syntax errors:** These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
  2. **Logic errors:** These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

- Okay, so it's not quite that simple — there are some other differentiators as you drill down deeper. But the above classifications will do at this early stage in your career. We'll look at both of these types going forward.

### Other common errors

- **SyntaxError: missing ; before statement**
  - This error generally means that you have missed a semicolon at the end of one of your lines of code, but it can sometimes be more cryptic.
