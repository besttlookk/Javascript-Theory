# Promise.resolve(): static method

The **Promise.resolve() method returns a Promise object** that is resolved with a given value.

If the value is a promise, that promise is returned; if the value is a thenable (i.e. has a "then" method), the returned promise will "follow" that thenable, adopting its eventual state; otherwise the returned promise will be fulfilled with the value.

This function flattens nested layers of promise-like objects (e.g. a promise that resolves to a promise that resolves to something) into a single layer.

#### **SYNTAX**

```js
Promise.resolve(value);

  value
Argument to be resolved by this Promise. Can also be a Promise or a thenable to resolve.
```

Returns A Promise that is resolved with the given value, or the promise passed as value, if the value was a promise object.

The static Promise.resolve function returns a **Promise that is resolved.**

#### **EXAMPLES**

> > **Using the static Promise.resolve method**

```js
Promise.resolve("Success").then(
  function (value) {
    console.log(value); // "Success"
  },
  function (value) {
    // not called
  }
);
```

> > **Resolving an array**

```js
var p = Promise.resolve([1, 2, 3]);
p.then(function (v) {
  console.log(v[0]); // 1
});
```

> > **Resolving another Promise**

```js
var original = Promise.resolve(33);
var cast = Promise.resolve(original);
cast.then(function (value) {
  console.log("value: " + value);
});
console.log("original === cast ? " + (original === cast));

// logs, in order:
// original === cast ? true
// value: 33
```

The inverted order of the logs is due to the fact that the then handlers are called asynchronously. See how then works here.

> > **Resolving thenables and throwing Errors**

```js
// Resolving a thenable object
var p1 = Promise.resolve({
  then: function (onFulfill, onReject) {
    onFulfill("fulfilled!");
  },
});
console.log(p1 instanceof Promise); // true, object casted to a Promise

p1.then(
  function (v) {
    console.log(v); // "fulfilled!"
  },
  function (e) {
    // not called
  }
);

// Thenable throws before callback
// Promise rejects
var thenable = {
  then: function (resolve) {
    throw new TypeError("Throwing");
    resolve("Resolving");
  },
};

var p2 = Promise.resolve(thenable);
p2.then(
  function (v) {
    // not called
  },
  function (e) {
    console.error(e); // TypeError: Throwing
  }
);

// Thenable throws after callback
// Promise resolves
var thenable = {
  then: function (resolve) {
    resolve("Resolving");
    throw new TypeError("Throwing");
  },
};

var p3 = Promise.resolve(thenable);
p3.then(
  function (v) {
    console.log(v); // "Resolving"
  },
  function (e) {
    // not called
  }
);
```
